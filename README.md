# Algorithms and Data Structures 

This repository contains algorithms and coding tasks solved in C++ and C# as part of my participation in the **TechWomen Mentorship Program**, guided by an experienced software developer. The tasks cover a wide range of algorithmic topics, from basic to advanced, with a focus on data structures, sorting, and searching. These exercises were designed to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of programming concepts.
